## Proposal

The ריטב"א and רש"י learn the question of the gemara האי סכנה אונס הוא as just a question in the לשון of the גמרא of why we are calling it a סכנה if they are not חייב to give their lives, but obviously we should change the day so as not to be מפקיר בנות ישראל, but תוס learns the גמרא as asking why should we change the day.
## Source

1. The ברייתא of [[שעת סכנה ואונס]] says that from the time of סכנה, people were נוהג to get married on Tuesday, and the חכמים were not מוחה, but on Monday it is still forbidden.
2. Ruvu explains that it was that if a בתולה gets married on Wednesday תיבעל להגמון תחלה.
3. The גמרא asks האי סכנה אונס הוא?
	+ On a simple level this is asking Why did חזל let them get married on Tuesday if it is an אונס, and אונס is מותר to her husband.
	+ The ריטב"א explains that it is asking that why do we call it a סכנה, if it is an אונס.
		+ He probably explained it this way because even if it is מותר, the גזירה is not a good reason to be מפקיר בנות ישראל.
4. The גמרא answers that there are צנועות who will give there life.
	+ The ריטב"א explains that it is called an סכנה because צנועות will give their life.
	+ The other explanation would explain that since it is a סכנה for צנועות, therefore they said it is מותר to get married on Tuesday.
5. The גמרא asks, so let people know that אונס is OK?
	+ The ריטב"א would need to this that it should not be called a סכנה because we can inform people that אונס is שרי.
	+ However, תוס explains that we should let people know, and once it is not a סקנה, we should tell them to get married on Wednesday? 
		+ This is the שיטה that the ריטב"א is trying to avoid.
6. The גמרא answers, there are פרוצות who will do it ברצון, and כוהנת who are אסור to their husbands even באונס, and the צנועות will give their lives.
	+ Tosfos explains משום פרוצות that we are no longer going with the פשט of משום צנועות, but are giving a new reason we can't let them get married on Wednesday, משום פרוצות.
	+ However, רשי explains that if we tell the צנועות it is ok, then the פרוצות will do it ברצון. 
		+ Q: Why did רשי not learn like תוס?
		+ A: He held like the ריטב"א, so even if אונס won't be מפקיר בנות ישראל, and Q is just לשון of סכנה, and פרוצות are either way not a סכנה.
## Challenges

1.  According to תוס, then there is no סכנה for פרוצות so if the תקנה is for them why call it a סכנה?
	+ We can answer that תוס is not concerned with לשון, just the דין of not מוחה, and use לשון of סכנה for כוהנת, but for פרוצות reason is just so not ברצון.
