## Proposal

The מהריק says that when אשת איש makes a woman אסור to her husband, it is not because of the עבירה, but rather because she was מעל in her husband, and she is only מותר if she was נתפשה.
## Source

1. The גמרא on כתובות נג make a דרשה form the פסוק by סוטה of והיא לא נתפשה, which implies that נתפשה is מותר.
2. The מהרי"ק asks, Why do we need such a דרשה, she is an אונס and not עובר the איסור?
3. He answers that even though she would not be עובר the איסור because [[ולנערה לא תעשה דבר]], she would still be אסור to the husband because it it a מעילה in him, ומעלה בו מעל, and she is only מותר to him if she has a פטור of נתפשה.
4. Based on this, the מהריק says that if a woman did not know that אשת איש was אסור, she would still be אסור to her husband because even though she was שוגג on the איסור, their is still a מעילה in the husband.
5. The מהריק also brings a proof from the fact that אסתר became אסור to מרדכי even though she did no איסור, she still became אסור to מרדכי like we דרשן in מגילה from כאשר אבדתי, אבדתי.
	+ We know that what אסתר did was מותר for הצלת כל ישראל, because the גמרא darshens ותלבש אסתר מלכות that she had רוח הקודש, so she must have not been doing something wrong.
6. We can bring a support to the מהריק because the פסוק from which we learn סוטה לבעליו, is the same פסוק from which we learn מחזיר גרושתו, in which the woman did no איסור.
## Challenges

1. The גמרא of [[שעת סכנה ואונס]] says after saying its a סכנה because the צנועות will give their life asks  ולדרוש להן דאונס שרי. We are talking about being מותר to their husbands, not just מותר to not give their lives. Why, this is not an אונס if they could get married on a different day and avoid it (see [[אונס שיכול להמלט]], and [[אונס & וחי בהם]]), just a היתר of וחיי בהם, and why would that help with being מותר to her husband?
	+ The ריב"ם says that she is not חייב to give her life because she is considered [[קרקע עולם]]. If this means that since she is passive the מעשה is not מתייחס to her then maybe this is better than the אונס of threatening to kill her, and this would not be considered ומעלה בו מעל.
	+ Maybe because the we were not מעקר the תקנה, just not מוחה therefore it is not considered יכולה להמלט.
	+ Maybe even though יכולה להמלט is not considered an אונס for ולנערה לא תעשה דבר, it is still considered נתפשה as long as it is an אונס בשעת מעשה
2. Why was אסתר not an אונס if מרדכי told her אל תדמי בנפשך, seemingly she was included in the גזירה so was doing it to save her life?
	+ Really she was not included in the גזירה and מרדכי was telling her על דרך נבואה that she would die if she did not fulfill her mission.
	+ This is not אונס, it is like מתרפא with an עבירה
