## Proposal

The ריב"ש holds that חזל would not be חייב to be מוסר נפש to not be עוקר  a תקנה in a שעת השמד, but רש"י and תוס hold they would have to, but would not need to to just move the תקנה to another day.

## Source

1. The ברייתא of [[שעת סכנה ואונס]] says that from the time of סכנה, people would get married on Thursday, and the חכמים were not מוחה. 
2. The גמרא asks, if it is a סכנה, why are we just not being מוחה, we should uproot it completely.
3. The ריב"ש asks why should we completely uproot it, this is clearly שעת השמד, so it should be חייב to be מוסר נפש?
4. He answers that the שמד is on the נשים, not חז"ל, so they could be מבטל it.
5. However, רשי and תוס both explain the גמרא that we should be מתקן another day instead. It seems that they are trying to get around the question of the ריב"ש, by saying that חזל would not uproot it, just move it, and be מתקן a different day to sit in ב"ד.

## Challenges

1. The גמרא later asks that if we change the day the הגמון will come earlier, and answers that he won't come for a ספק, which means just moving the day won't help.
	+ It seems that תוס was trying to avoid this question when he says _דאם יקבעו יום אחר לא יחושו_, but it is hard to understand why. Maybe it takes longer for the government to switch גזירות, then for the הגמון to just come on a different day.
2. Even though רש"י and תוס give the same answer, תוס says יום אחר, and רש"י says ימים אחרים. They both mean pick one other day, but רש"י says they can pick one of multiple other days. However, isn't the only option Thursday, because we need 3 days for שקדו.
