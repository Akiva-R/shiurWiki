## Proposal

The רי מיגש, the רמב"ם, and רש"י hold that in the time of תקנת עזרא, there was a קביעות יום to get married on Wednesday, and even if one was טורח before שבת, they still may not get married on Sunday, but nowadays, where there is no תקנת עזרא, there is no קביעות יום at all. The רמב"ן however holds that during the time of תקנת עזרא, one could get married on Sunday if they prepared before שבת, and were only פטור from מזונות because חזל were not מחייב him to prepare before שבת. However, on Wednesday, it is possible that  חזל allowed him to get married even without preparing, and if so, this הלכה would apply even in a place without תקנת עזרא.
## Source

1. The גמרא in the סוגיא of [[בתולה נשאת בכל יום]], asks that even if there is no תקנת עזרא so no חשש of טענת בתולים, why should we not at least be worried about שקדו. It answers that the person was טורח before שבת.
2. The רמב"ן says that even in a place that has תקנת עזרא, one can get on Sunday if they were טורח before שבת. He says that this is why the משנה of [[בתולה נשאת ביום הרבעי]] leaves out שקדו as a reason and just mentions טענת בתולים.
3. Q: If even in a place of תקנת עזרא one can get married on Sunday, then why does the גמרא say he is פטור if [[הגיע זמן באחד]]?
4. A: The רא"ה explains that חזל were not מחייב you to prepare before שבת, but you can if you want to.
5. However, the שטמ"ק is מדייק in רש"י that in the time of תקנת עזרא, you could not get married on Sunday even if you were טורח before שבת.
6. He must hold that in places of תקנת עזרא, once חזל were קובע יום לנשואין because of טענת בתולים, they also were קובע Wednesday and not Sunday because of שקדו. However, in places with no תקנת עזרא, then שקדו alone is not enough of a reason to be קובע יום, and the דין of שקדו is just that one must be טורח three days.
7. Q: The רמב"ם says that if הגיע זמן on Sunday, then you are פטור from מזונות because of [[גזירה שמא ישחט בן עוף]]. This implies that you are חייב on Monday. However the רמב"ם himself says that you need to be טורח for three days before getting married meaning he holds of שקדו. He must argue on the רמב"ן, and hold that the fact that you can be טורח before שבת makes you not an אונס for not being able to marry her on Sunday, so he has to come on to the reason of שמא ישחט בן עוף. However, why then in the סוגיא of [[הגיע זמן באחד]], is he פטור from מזונות until Wednesday if the fact that you can be טורח before שבת makes you considered not an אונס?
8. A: The רמב"ם must hold like רש"י that in the time of תקנת עזרא, then חזל were קובע יום that you can only get married on Wednesday.
9. The רי' מיגש says this גמרא is a proof that the כלה can force the חתן to be טורח for the סעודה three days. He brings the proof from [[בתולה נשאת בכל יום]], and not [[הגיע זמן באחד]], because from there we just see that in a place of תקנת עזרא there is a קביעות יום to get married on Wednesday, but not that you can't get married without preparing. From here we see that even though there is no קביעות יום, you still can't get married without being טרח.
10. The רמב"ן says that he agrees with this דין, but that this גמרא is not a proof. This is because he could hold that the קביעות יום of Wednesday was that you can get married then even without preparing beforehand, as opposed to Sunday where you would have to be טרח. This היתר to get married on Wednesday without preparing beforehand might still apply when תקנת עזרא is בטול. 
11. The טור actually says that one can get married on Wednesday without being טורח.
## Challenges

+ According to רש"י, the רמב"ם, and the רי' מיגש we are only קובע יום because of טענת בתולים, but שקדו alone would not be קובע יום. This means that טענת בתולים is more important than שקדו. If so, then why in the סוגיא of [[שעת סכנה ואונס]], why were חז"ל not מוחה when people were getting married on Tuesday, Sunday is better because we get טענת בתולים which is more important than two days of שקדו? See [[Answer to why Tuesday instead of Sunday]] for an answer.

## Alternative Approaches

+ See [[שיטת הרמבם בענין שקדו]] for alternate ways of learning the רמב"ם.
