## Proposal

In שעת סכנה, even though really Sunday would be a better day than Tuesday because טענת בתולים is more important than 2 days of שקדו, once the עם was נוהג to get married on Tuesday, חזל could not be מוחה and tell them to get married on Sunday, because that would be מעקר the original תקנה, and we don't want to uproot it because the שמד is going to pass.
## Source

1. The ברייתא of [[שעת סכנה ואונס]] says that rom the time of סכנה, people were נוהג to get married on Tuesday, and the חכמים were not מוחה, but on Monday it is still forbidden.
2. The גמרא asks why are we not מעקר it completely.
3. It answers that the שמד will pass, and we want the תקנה to still be there after.
4. We asked, would it not be better to tell them to do it on Sunday to at least get טענת בתולים.
	+ This question is even stronger according to the שיטה we mentioned in [[גדר תקנת שקדו]] that only טענת בתולים is enough of a reason to be קובע יום, and שקדו is just that once we are being קובע יום, we pick Wednesday instead of Sunday.
5. Maybe we can answer that really Sunday would be a better day, and the ברייתא is just telling me a מעשה שהיה that people would do it on Tuesday. חזל would rather they did it on Sunday, but if they tell them to do it on Sunday, that would be uprooting the גזירה to get married on Wednesday, and the גמרא says "שמדא עבידא דבטלא ותקנתא דרבנן מקמי שמדא לא עקרינן". Therefore they were not מוחה, rather than telling them to get married on Sunday and uprooting the תקנה.
## Challenges

+ In רש"י ד"ה ובשני לא יכנוס he says "בשביל אותה סכנה ואין צריך לעקור בשבילה תקנת חכמים אלא יום אחד ויהיה טורח מיהת שני ימים בצורכי סעודה" , it seems that he is saying חזל want Tuesday to get at least 2 days of שקדו?
	+ We can answer that רש"י is not telling us why Tuesday is the best, he is just telling us that Tuesday is better than Monday, so once people were נוהג to do it on  Tuesday, they were מוחה against doing it on Monday. We can see this because רשי only said this on ד"ה ובשני לא יכנוס, not ולא מיחו.
